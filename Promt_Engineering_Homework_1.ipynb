The country is divided into 28 states and 8 union territories, each with its own government and legislature.\n",
            "\n",
            "India's history dates back to one of the world's first urban civilizations, the Indus Valley Civilization, which existed around 2600-1900 BCE. Since then, India has seen the rise and fall of numerous empires, including the Maurya, Gupta, Mughal, and British empires. India gained its independence from British rule on August 15, 1947, after a long struggle for freedom.\n",

            "India is known for its rich and diverse culture, which is reflected in its music, dance, art, literature, and cuisine. The country is home to several religions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, Islam, and Christianity.

            "1. \"Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!\" This joke is quite good because it plays on the double meaning of \"make up\" - to compose or form something, and to lie or fabricate something. The joke is essentially saying that atoms are untrustworthy because they are the building blocks of everything (a true statement), but also because they lie or deceive (a false statement), which creates an amusing incongruity.\n",
            "2. \"Why was the math book sad? Because it had too many problems.\" This joke is mediocre because it relies on a simple pun. While the joke plays on the double meaning of \"problems\" - mathematical problems and issues or difficulties - the setup is a bit forced and the punchline is not particularly surprising or funny.\n",
            "3. \"What do you call fake spaghetti? An impasta!\" This joke is good because it is a clever play on words. The joke combines the word \"spaghetti\" with the word \"impasta\" (a pun on \"impostor\"), suggesting that the spaghetti is fake or not authentic. The joke is well-constructed and has a good rhythm to it.\n",
            "4. \"I would tell you a joke about an elevator, but it's an uplifting experience.\" This joke is not very good because it is too predictable and relies on a tired cliché. The joke is essentially saying that an elevator joke would be \"uplifting,\" but the setup is overused and the punchline is not particularly original or funny.\n",
            "5. \"Why did the scarecrow win an award? Because he was outstanding in his field!\" This joke is good because it is a classic pun that plays on the double meaning of \"outstanding\" - to be superior or remarkable, and to stand out or stick up. The joke is well-known and has a good punchline that is both surprising and amusing.\n"
